# Using an ATM: A Quick Reference Guide

You can use an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) for carrying out various financial transactions, such as withdrawing money, depositing checks, and viewing your account balance. An ATM allows you to perform these operations conveniently, without needing to visit a bank branch during business hours.

This quick-reference guide provides basic information about the main parts of a typical ATM and step-by-step instructions for executing the core financial operations.

**Before You Begin:**

Ensure you have the following items with you:

* Your ATM card issued by your bank.
* Your confidential PIN (Personal Identification Number).
* A properly filled check, sealed in an envelope, if you intend to deposit a check.

## 1. Parts of a Typical ATM

While ATMs can vary in design, they generally have the following main parts:

*(Note: A real user manual would include a figure here showing the location of these parts.)*

* **Card Reader:** A slot where you insert your ATM card. It is often illuminated.
* **Keypad:** A set of numbered buttons (0-9) and function keys (like ENTER, CLEAR, CANCEL) used to enter your PIN and select options. It is usually located below the screen.
* **Display Screen:** Shows messages, transaction options, and information. It may have buttons alongside it for selecting options.
* **Cash Dispenser:** A slot where the machine delivers the cash you withdraw. It typically opens only when cash is ready to be collected.
* **Deposit Slot:** A slot where you insert envelopes containing checks or cash for deposit. This slot usually opens only when you initiate a deposit transaction.
* **Receipt Printer:** A slot where you can collect a printed receipt for your transaction, if requested.

Interaction with an ATM primarily happens using the card reader, keypad, and display screen buttons. The machine's responses and transaction details are shown on the display screen, and cash is delivered via the cash dispenser.

## 2. Accessing the Transaction Menu

All transaction options supported by the ATM can be accessed from the main transaction menu. Follow these steps to get started:

1.  Insert your ATM card into the card reader slot. Ensure the card is oriented correctly, usually with the chip facing up or forward, following any arrows on the machine.
2.  The display screen will show a message, typically `Enter your PIN`.
3.  Using the keypad, carefully enter your four-digit PIN.
    * **Security Tip:** Always cover the keypad with your other hand while entering your PIN to prevent anyone from seeing it.
    * **Tip:** If you make a mistake while entering your PIN, press the `CLEAR` key on the keypad and reenter the correct digits.
    * **Warning:** If you enter an incorrect PIN three times in a row, your account may be temporarily locked for security reasons. If this happens, contact your bank's nearest branch or customer service.
4.  After entering your PIN, press the `ENTER` key on the keypad to confirm.

The transaction menu will appear on the display screen, listing the available operations.

*(Note: A real user manual would include a figure here showing an example transaction menu.)*

**Completing Your Transaction(s):**

* After each transaction, the ATM will typically ask if you wish to perform another transaction. Select `Yes` to return to the main menu or `No` to end your session.
* You may also be given the option to receive a printed receipt for your transaction. If you choose this, collect the receipt from the receipt printer slot.
* When you have finished all your transactions and selected 'No' to perform another, the ATM will eject your card. **It is very important to remember to take your ATM card from the card reader slot before leaving the machine.**
