# Markdown Essentials
---
## Introduction
Markdown is a _lightweight markup_ language created by **John Gruber**. It aims to let you focus on creating _content_ without getting bogged down by the complex _syntax_ typically found in other markup languages like HTML or XML. The syntaxes supported by Markdown are easy to remember and quickly become second nature with minimal practice.
With the rise of the 'docs-as-code' approach, Markdown has proven to be an essential backbone, allowing both developers and technical writers to contribute to documentation without complex tags and formatting, or the need of specialized authoring tools. 

Remember that using one asterisk (`*`) or underscore (`_`) before and after content renders it as _italic_, while using two asterisks (`**`) or underscores (`__`) renders it as **bold**. As simple as it gets!
