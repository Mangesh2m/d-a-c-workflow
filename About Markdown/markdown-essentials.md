## Introduction

With the rise of the _docs-as-code_ approach in documentation, Markdown has proven to be an essential backbone, allowing both developers and technical writers to contribute to documentation without complex tags and formatting or specialized authoring tools.

Markdown is a lightweight markup language created by **John Gruber** that enables you to focus squarely on creating content, without getting bogged down by the complex syntax, typically found in other markup languages like HTML or XML. Its simple syntax is easy to remember and quickly becomes second nature with minimal practice.

Below is a summary of the most-used Markdown syntax, which also includes select GitHub-flavored Markdown (GFM) additions:

### Styling

1. Using one asterisk (`*`) or underscore (`_`) before and after content renders it as italic (e.g., *italic*); using two renders it as bold (e.g., **bold**).

2. Starting a line with a greater-than sign (`>`) renders it as a blockquote.
   > A quote here

3. Using double tildes (`~~`) before and after content renders it as ~~crossed-out text~~
